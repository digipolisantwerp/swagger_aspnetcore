# Digipolis Swagger library

Digipolis Antwerp uses the [Swagger](https://swagger.io) library for API documentation.  
Our library adds a Swagger startup extension that, by default, adds custom Digipolis operator filters that follow the [Digipolis API guidelines](https://acpaas-api.digipolis.be#/).

## Target framework

This package targets **.NET Standard 2.1**.

## Installation

To add the library to a project, you add the package to the csproj file :

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Digipolis.swagger" Version="1.0.7" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

In Visual Studio you can also use the NuGet Package Manager to do this.

## Usage

This library serves as the Digipolis Swagger extensions library. It contains the service collection extension method to register the 
Digipolis Swagger options, to be called in the **ConfigureServices** method of the **Startup** class.

```csharp  
services.AddDigipolisSwagger(options =>
    {
        options.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo
        {
            Title = "Your API title",
            Description = "Your API description",
            Version = "v1",
            Contact = new OpenApiContact
            {
                Email = "your.email@digipolis.be",
                Name = "Your name"
            },
            License = new OpenApiLicense
            {
                Name = "None",
                Url = null,
            },
        });
    });
```

This method adds basic operator filters that abide the rules set by the [Digipolis API guidelines](https://acpaas-api.digipolis.be#/).
Make sure to fill in the SwaggerDoc option as this one is not automatically set.

In the **Configure** method of the **Startup** class you should also add the UseDigipolisSwagger middleware. Like this for example:
```csharp  
app.UseDigipolisSwagger();
```

You can also include a collection of versions if you need to include multiple version. To do this change the UseDigipolisSwagger to:

```csharp  
app.UseDigipolisSwagger(versionProvider.ApiVersionDescriptions.Select(a => a.GroupName));
```

## Custom options

This library extends the original SwaggerGenOptions with additional default properties. If you wish to prevent certain default options to be added simply set these options to false, or if you do want them to be added simple set them to true (if they are not yet true by default).

```csharp  
services.AddDigipolisSwagger(options =>
    {
        options.DefaultAddAuthorizationHeaderRequired = false;
    });
```

Here is a complete overview of the additional options to be set:

| Option                                | Description                                                  | Default |
